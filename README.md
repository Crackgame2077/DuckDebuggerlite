# Duck Debugger (Chatbot Project using Microsoft DialoGPT and Flask)
#### Video Demo:  <[URL HERE>](https://youtu.be/2X0c05t1Zls) 
Overview
This project aims to create an interactive web application that leverages Microsoft DialoGPT, a pre-trained language model, to generate human-like responses in a chat interface. By integrating DialoGPT with Flask, a popular Python web framework, we will build a backend server that handles user inputs and returns appropriate responses. The frontend of the application will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a visually appealing and engaging user experience.

Features
Intelligent Responses: Utilize Microsoft DialoGPT to generate human-like responses to user prompts.
Web-Based Interface: Interact with the chatbot through a user-friendly web interface.
Seamless Integration: Connect the backend (Flask) with the frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for smooth communication.
Interactive Chat Interface: Use jQuery to handle HTTP requests and update the chat interface dynamically.
Technologies Used
Backend:

Microsoft DialoGPT: A pre-trained language model for generating conversational responses.
Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python that helps in building web applications quickly and easily.
Frontend:

HTML: For structuring the web pages.
CSS: For styling the chat interface to make it visually appealing.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity to the chat interface.
jQuery: For handling HTTP requests and updating the chat interface dynamically.
